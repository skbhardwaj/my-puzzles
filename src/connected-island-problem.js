/*
THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
======================
The Connected Island Problem

Given the data of islands in form of 0s & 1s, wherein 0s represent water & 1s represent land.
We need to find all the connected islands(connected 1s) from the data provided.
Hint: Consider all 8 directions! [E,W,N,S,NE,NW,SE,SW]

The input would be in the form of 2 lines:
1st line = size of the matrix
2nd line = data of matrix

EXAMPLE:
========
Input(visual):
--------------
5 5
0001010011110000100001110

i.e. visually,

          0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    [
0        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
1        [1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
2        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
3        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
4        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
    ]

Output:
-------
Total Islands: 2

Island 1:
[[0][3], [1][3], [1][4]]

Island 2:
[[1][0], [2][0], [2][1], [3][1], [4][1], [4][2], [4][3]]
